    <p>The book introduces Trevor Noahâ€™s childhood and how it was growing up in
       <br> South Africa during apartheid which is a policy that is founded on the idea <br>of separating people based on racial or ethnic criteria of a person. because<br> of this Trevor narrates how hard it was for him to live freely like a normal <br>child to the point that he could not even go out to the streets and play <br> It sheds light on how his existence is evidence of the big crime that his<br> parents committed. </p>



     <p>Growing up in Soweto, Trevor narrates how he faces challenges of <br>belonging to multiple racial groups and this made him often feel like an<br> outsider in the black community because he had a light complexion<br>
         compared to the other black kids and in the white community. <br>After all, he had a darker complexion.

     </p>   

     <p>The outstanding content on the script is his relationship with his mother<br>
         who plays a central role in his family since he only saw his father once in a<br>
          while. It is clearly narrated how she constantly displayed independence<br> and assertiveness during the script.

In connection with my country, we get to see the racial dynamics in South<br> Africa and the different tribes and cultures that also exist in my country. By <br>
them being soo different from each other, we get to see how both regions <br>struggle with identity that was mainly brought about by the white settlers in <br>
their regions.
 
        </p>
   
        <p>
            We also get to see consistent themes for family and resilience which is very <br>common in my county
